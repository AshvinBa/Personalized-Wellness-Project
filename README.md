# Personalized-Wellness-Project
In this project, user health data such as age, gender, body measurements, lifestyle habits, and food preferences is analyzed to assess overall health. Based on this information, a health score is generated to represent the user’s current health status and identify areas for improvement in diet, nutrition, and lifestyle.
